        We create our wedding videos and photos based on natural emotions.
        Gesture, light, movement - these are three indispensable elements that
        intertwine in our shots and wedding photos. We love glamor, slow
        wedding, rustic, boho and garden parties. With our human resources we
        tell about emotions, atmosphere, friends, family, and most of all about
        you! Let's create amazing wedding photos and videos that tell your story
        together.
